# neighborhoodconnect
We are team 6ix and we plan to make an application to help communities everywhere. The app NeighborhoodConnect is designed to help elderly residents of a community connect with their community through events, help lines, and transportation in the community. We hope that this would make life easier and better for everyone in the community.
    We hope that this would also help those who are not elderly better connect with all members in their community while also allowing a simple and easy method for elderly members to access more resources. We also hope that we can help communities of every demographic, shape, and size. We will emphasize accessibility for all users as the target audience is not adept with using technology, and we hope that will increase use and effectiveness.
